# Tic-Tac-Toe Project

This website allows you to play tic-tac-toe either against an automated computer opponent or another player locally. Inspiration and direction for the project came from the Tic-Tac-Toe project in The Odin Project's curriculum. https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-tic-tac-toe
